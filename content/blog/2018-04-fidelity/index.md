I joined Fidelity International as a contractor for the Front-End JavaScript Applications Team. I was given complete ownership of a new project, and was set the task of developing a product from the ground up that could be completely controlled via a Python Django CMS. Being given the reigns of what Front-End architecture I could use, I opted for React & Redux.

Additionally to developing products, I took on responsibilities such as:

* Interviewing many new candidates to join our team.
* Worked closely with project managers to give reliable updates on active projects and backlog items.
* Mentored other developers through their on-boarding of React/Redux, becoming a go-to guy for help.
* In order to keep up with the high demand of work, I worked with the Python Django CMS running on Docker to help to ensure we as a team met our targets.

We worked using Scrum/Agile methodologies with Daily Stand-ups and retrospectives to ensure constant improvement in the team.
