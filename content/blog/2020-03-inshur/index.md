<Greeting message="Welcome to Inshur!" />
```

I joined Inshur in 2020 where I was set the task of building a mobile first web  application that would be used by the drivers of their partner Uber across the UK, US and the Netherlands. I had the responsibility of designing the application from theory through to production, while helping build a team in the process.

Key Achievements/Responsibilities:
* Taking sole responsibility for designing and developing their multi-lingual flagship application used by thousands of Uber drivers across multiple nations.
* Aiding in building a team of 15+ highly motivated and productive engineers.
* Engaging in regular high-level planning sessions with management & clients to shape future projects.
* Working closely with the lead CloudOps engineer to develop a bespoke Infrastructure-as-code deployment pipeline for a suite of micro-services, built using Kubernetes & Terraform.
* Developed multiple systems outside of work hours to help improve internal productivity, that were widely used and later adopted as official projects.
