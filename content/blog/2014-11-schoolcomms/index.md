At Schoolcomms I was part of a team of engineers responsible for building a portal used by teachers, parents and students. The applications involved were built natively for web, iOS, Android and Windows.

Key Achievements/Responsibilities:
* Worked as a technical lead requiring me to manage workload and offer confident and reliable estimates at each stage of the projects.
* Implemented a direct debit payments system used to process over Â£4m a month.
* Running business-orientated product demos of new features and applications.
* Rebuilt an application used by thousands of parents at over 3000 schools.
* Designed and built an Apple Watch application outside of work, that would be used by thousands of students across the UK.
* Aided in interviewing candidates to join the development team.
* Created new applications used to boost productivity that became an essential part of colleagues day-to-day.
