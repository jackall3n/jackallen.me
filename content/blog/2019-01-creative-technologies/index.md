```typescript
const message: string = "Welcome to Creative Technologies!";
```

As a partner of both Schroders and Lloyds, Creative Technologies is responsible for supplying the asset management software used by both their financial advisors and clients. I was brought in to assist in the construction of an integrated word processing application used to generate financial reports.
After adopting the scaled agile framework SAFe, I was given the opportunity to attend collaborative sessions such as I&A and P.I planning. There I was able to feed into the longer term roadmap and help prioritise with the wider organisation.

Key Achievements/Responsibilities:
* Assisting the in construction of a bespoke word processor.
* Developing a suite of unit tests covering more than 90% of the codebase.
* Introducing a wide range of automated tests using Cucumber and Selenium.
* Mentoring developers through the transition to Typescript for existing JavaScript projects.
