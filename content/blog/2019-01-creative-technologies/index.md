```typescript
const message: string = "Welcome to Creative Technologies!";
```

I joined Creative Technologies Limited as part of their React front end team. Our teams responsibilities were to develop a greenfield reporting application used by clients within Schroders and Lloyds.

The company migrated to working within the scaled agile framework **SAFe**, which provided opportunity to feed into the longer term roadmap and help prioritise with the wider organisation.

Key responsibilities/achievements:

* Building a project from the ground up with the latest coding standards.
* Providing a suite of unit tests with code coverage of 100%.
* Composed an end-to-end suite of automated tests using Cucumber and Selenium.
* Mentoring developers through their transition from Javascript to Typescript.

The methodologies adopted as part of the SAFe migration include PI planning, Retrospectives, I&A sessions, Weekly demos, Backlog refinements and Stand-ups.
