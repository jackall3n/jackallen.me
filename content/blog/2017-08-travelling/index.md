```java
public static String Greeting() {
    return 'Welcome!';
}
```

Leaving the world of development behind wasn't easy, so to keep up-to-date while I was away, and get my developer-fix, I was hired to create an app for a restaurant in India that would allow them to take orders from a table and it would notify the kitchen, bar and accountant simultaneously.

The app was built for Android devices on top of a Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database and Cloud Messaging. It was developed from a hammock on Palolem beach and was completed in ~10 days.
