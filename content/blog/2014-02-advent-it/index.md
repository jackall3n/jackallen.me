```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Welcome to Advent IT!");
```
Having completed my apprenticeship I set out for a new challenge. I found Advent IT, a bespoke software company, where I was able to work on a large range of platforms and really broaden my knowledge of front and back-end development. After a short time, Advent IT was purchased by our largest client and we migrated across into Schoolcomms.
